**Project Title: Real-time Sensor Data Analysis and Prediction Dashboard**

**Project Description:**

The goal of this project is to leverage the WESAD CSV dataset for a comprehensive real-time sensor data analysis and prediction system. The project involves specific data analytics, regression modeling techniques in Python with PySpark, and aims to enhance user awareness through a warning system incorporated into a Tableau dashboard.

**Key Project Tasks:**

1. **Data Ingestion and Real-time Streaming:**
   - Ingest the WESAD CSV dataset into a Kafka topic using PySpark's Kafka API for seamless integration.
   - Utilize PySpark's Structured Streaming for real-time processing and analysis of the streaming sensor data.
   - Apply statistical analysis techniques using Python to identify patterns and anomalies in the data.

2. **Tableau Dashboard Development:**
   - Develop a Tableau dashboard to visualize real-time sensor data.
   - Utilize Python's Tableau Hyper API for seamless integration with PySpark.
   - Include visualizations such as line charts, heat maps, and scatter plots to represent sensor trends.
   - Implement Tableau actions for interactive user exploration of the data.

3. **Predictive Modeling:**
   - Utilize historical sensor data to train a regression model in Python (e.g., using scikit-learn).
   - Feature engineering: Extract relevant features from the dataset using PySpark, considering factors such as time of day, day of the week, and any other contextual information.
   - Implement a continuous learning process, updating the regression model in real-time as new data becomes available.
   - Integrate the regression model's predictions into the Tableau dashboard using Python.

4. **User Warning System Integration:**
   - Define thresholds based on statistical analysis and model predictions to trigger warnings.
   - Implement a real-time alerting system using PySpark and Python.
   - Embed alerts directly within the Tableau dashboard, providing users with immediate notifications of potential issues.

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Seamless integration of WESAD CSV dataset into a Kafka topic using PySpark.
- Real-time processing and analysis of sensor data using PySpark's Structured Streaming and Python.
- A dynamic Tableau dashboard with interactive visualizations for real-time sensor data exploration, using Python for data processing.
- Implementation of a regression model in Python for predictive insights.
- Integration of a robust user warning system providing real-time alerts within the Tableau dashboard using Python.

**Benefits:**
- Improved decision-making through real-time insights and predictive analytics using Python.
- Proactive identification of potential issues through immediate user alerts.
- Enhanced user experience with an intuitive and informative Tableau dashboard.
